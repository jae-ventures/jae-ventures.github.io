Hi there, I'm Jordan! I'm a software developer venturing into some interesting topics due to my fascination with sustainable transportation. What started as a passion for electric vehicles led me to deeper questions about the ramifications of our sustainable future: How do we make this green technology transition both effective and ethical?

Questions like this arose as I explored the ethical issues of battery material sourcing and the difficult history of how infrastructure for the automobile has shaped our lives in the U.S. for better and worse. This led me to start seeking how better city design may be the answer to more equittable transit and better lived daily lives.

These days, you'll find me coding, reading solarpunk and afrofuturism literature, and dreaming up similar ways to build a better future through electrified transit and technology purposely designed to help people thrive where they live. Through this blog, I share my journey of connecting these dots – from software development to sustainable transit to human-centered urban design. 🏙️

Venture with me as we envision and build toward a future where our cities work better for everyone. I might recommend a good book or two along the way to convince you to stick around! ⚡📗
